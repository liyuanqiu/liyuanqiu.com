# Don't use destructuring assignment with react-redux `useSelector`

## ðŸ‘‰ Destructuring assignment

Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment

Example:

```javascript
const obj = {
  foo: 1,
  bar: 'hello',
  baz: true,
};
// Destructuring assignment
const { foo, bar, baz } = obj;
```

This syntax is very convenient to read the properties from an object and assign them to the variables.

## ðŸ‘‰ react-redux `useSelector`

Reference: https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks#useselector

Example:

```javascript
const bar = useSelector(state => state.foo.bar);
```

`useSelector` subscribes to the Redux store, and run your selector whenever an action is dispatched.

## ðŸ‘‰ Don't use them together!

Suppose we have such a Redux state hierarchy:

```typescript
// typescript typing
interface State {
  foo: {
    bar: number;
    baz: boolean;
  };
  qux: number;
}
```

And in the React component, we use `useSelector` with destructuring assignment:

```javascript
function SomeComponent() {
  const { bar } = useSelector(state => state.foo);
  // make some logs
  console.log(1);
  return ...
}
```

Let's update the Redux state:

```javascript
// update state.foo.baz
store.dispatch(updateBazAction());
```

Unfortunately, the `console.log(1)` was excuted, obviously it is not expected.

## ðŸ‘‰ Why?

If we update `state.foo.baz` immutably, the reference of `state.foo` will be changed.

So each time an action is dispatched, the selector returns a new object. That will cause the React component to render.

More clearly, this line:

```javascript
const { bar } = useSelector(state => state.foo);
```

is just equivalent to:

```javascript
const foo = useSelector(state => state.foo);
const { bar } = foo;
```

So it's better not to use destructuring assignment with react-redux `useSelector` together, even if you can manually ensure bug-free right now.

In the long run, the Redux state hierarchy in your project may be changed, the old-good code may cause bugs again.

Example:
This snippet is bug-free now:

```typescript
interface State {
  foo: {
    bar: number;
  };
}
const { bar } = useSelector(state => state.foo);
```

And several weeks later, your teammate adds a `baz` to `foo` and update it very frequently, your code will cause a performance issue.

```typescript
interface State {
  foo: {
    bar: number;
    baz: boolean;
  };
}
```
