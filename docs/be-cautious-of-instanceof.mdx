# Be cautious of `instanceof`

As is known to many JavaScript developers, the `instanceof` operator tests whether the `prototype` property of a constructor appears anywhere in the prototype chain of an object.

See some examples first:

```javascript
const a = [];
a instanceof Array; // true
a instanceof Object; // true
a instanceof Number; // false

class Foo {}
new Foo() instanceof Foo; // true
new Foo() instanceof Object; // true
new Foo() instanceof Array; // false
```

Looks working perfectly, but sometimes, `instanceof` causes confusing, so let’s dive in and see what’s wrong.

## Store 1: `new Foo()` is not an instance of `Foo`?

Assuming we have 2 libraries:

```javascript
// Library A
export class Foo() {}
```

```javascript
// Library B
import { Foo } from 'A';
export function test(a) {
  return a instanceof Foo;
}

// B's package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "A": <version>
  }
}
```

And our business code:

```javascript
import { Foo } from 'A';
import { test } from 'B';

const foo = new Foo();

console.log(test(foo)); // will print false!!!

// package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "A": <version>,
    "B": <version>
  }
}
```

The code above will print `false` !!!
Does it mean `new Foo()` is not an instance of `Foo`?
OBVIOUSLY NOT!!!

Let's dig into the details:

- Library B depends on A, so its author added A into B's `dependencies`
- Business code also depends on A, so A is added to `dependencies` too

Do you feel something wrong?
Yes, totally right, the truth is that THEY USE DIFFERENT A.
See the project structure:

```plain
.
├── index.js
└── node_modules
    ├── A
    └── B
        └── node_modules
            └── A
```

`node_modules/A` is not `node_modules/B/node_modules/A`

### So how to avoid this problem?

##### Solution 1:

If it is a strong requirement to test whether a variable is an instance of `Foo`, it's better to add a static method `isFoo` to `Foo`:

```javascript
class Foo() {
  static isFoo() {
    // Performs more robust checking
  }
}
```

##### Solution 2:

B can mark A as a peer dependence, so it can share the same A with its users:

```javascript
// B's package.json
{
  "peerDependencies": {
    "A": <version>
  }
}
```

##### Solution 3:

B stops using `instanceof`, and performs testing by other features of A. Similar to solution 1.

## Store 2: `Array.isArray` vs `instanceof Array`?

```javascript
const iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
document.body.appendChild(iframe);
const { Array: YaArray } = window.frames[window.frames.length - 1];

const a = new Array(1, 2, 3);
const ya = new YaArray(1, 2, 3);

a instanceof Array; // true
ya instanceof Array; // false

Array.isArray(a); // true
Array.isArray(ya); // true
```

Yes, same problem with Store 1, `Array` is not `YaArray`.

```javascript
Array === YaArray; // false
```

We can see, `Array` chooses the solution 1 above, it provides `isArray` static method to test instances.

## Conclusion

- As a library developer, you should be very cautious of `instanceof`. Choose the IS method first like `Array.isArray`, or implement it yourself. If must use `instanceof`, make sure that the constructors on both sides of `instanceof` are not your own dependencies, they should be listed in the `peerDependencies` to share with your users.
- As a project developer, you just need to take responsibility to your own. Check both sides of `instanceof`, make sure they have the same constructor, not just the same name.
