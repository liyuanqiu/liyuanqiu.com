# Mental Overhead of React Hooks

When we first get in touch with `React hooks`, I believe most of us were excited, and couldn't wait to dine.

But very soon, we found that it dirtied our mouth, and then realized the truth:

> React Hooks is not that easy to master

---

Let's see some snippets:

```typescript
// This is a typical custom hook
// It fetches "foo" from server
function useFoo(): undefined | Foo {
  const [foo, setFoo] = useState<undefined | Foo>();
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(...)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(json => setFoo(json));
  }, []);
  return foo;
}
```

The custom hook `useFoo` is very easy to understand. The return value will be `undefined` until the server gives back a correct JSON.

And let's see another custom hook:

```typescript
function useBar(foo: Foo): Bar {
  return useMemo(() => {
    // returns a bar instance which is computed using foo
  }, [foo]);
}
```

NOTE!!! THE SHOW BEGINS ↓↓↓

```typescript
import useFoo from './useFoo';
import useBar from './useBar';

function MyReactComponent() {
  const foo = useFoo();
  // Ooops! Some jam splashed on my face！
  const bar = useBar(foo);

  return ...;
}
```

An error occurred because `useBar` only accepts parameter `foo` as `Foo`, not `undefined | Foo`. So we should check the value of `foo` in some place:

```typescript
function MyReactComponent() {
  const foo = useFoo();
  if (foo === undefined) {
    return null;
  }
  // Pick up the handkerchief...
  const bar = useBar(foo);

  return ...;
}
```

Obviously it is a big mistake to call hooks conditionally.

So we had to try another way...

```typescript
function useBar(foo: undefined | Foo): Bar {
  return useMemo(() => {
    if (foo === undefined) {
      return <Return what??? Another undefined???>;
    }
    // returns a bar instance which is computed using foo
  }, [foo]);
}
```

We can put the `if` statement into `useBar`, but really ugly, no elegance at all:

- To `useFoo`, it is reasonable to return `undefined | Foo`, its behavior is exactly matching with the logic.
- To `useBar`, there's totally no need to accept an `undefined` foo, remember its name is not `useBarByUseFoo`.

If `useBar` accepts the `undefined` foo, what `bar` should be returned? An empty `Bar` object? Or just `undefined`? Neither is reasonable.

So finally, I choose to wrap `MyReactComponent`:

```typescript
import useFoo from './useFoo';
import useBar from './useBar';

function MyReactComponent({ foo }: { foo: Foo }) {
  const bar = useBar(foo);

  return ...;
}

function FooWrapper() {
  const foo = useFoo();
  if (foo === undefined) {
    return null;
  }
  return <MyReactComponent foo={foo} />;
}

export default FooWrapper;
```

Finally, I cleaned my mouth, but have no appetite to eat anymore.

React Hooks is cool, but really need a strong programming sense. Write hooks, rethink it, refactor it, a loop, until retired.
